         Student’s Report Card System

Introduction - Student report card system project in C++ is a simple project built without the use of graphics. In this project, users can perform typical report card related functions like adding a new student record and displaying, modifying, editing and deleting it.

Motivation - To build a report card system where user can build a report card of students. Both students and teachers can access the projects

Objective - This program named- “Report Card Management System”, aims at helping teachers and students to work with report cards in an organized manner. It makes provisions for adding, deleting, displaying and various other functions on student records. All the records are saved to data files.
The program has three access levels- Teacher, Student and Public. The Teacher function (accessed by a password) has administrator rights over the records and can manipulate the records in any way. The Student and Public are restricted to the viewership of the records and statistical analysis.

Approach - It is a very simple project which works on 3 header files 
1.#inclulde<iostream>
2.#include<fstream>
3.#include<iomanip>
File handling has been used for the effective implementation of all the typical features of this project .
I have started the program with a class student in which I have declared some variables and made some functions like void getdata() , void showdata() ,etc.
Some functions are declared globally like void write_student() – here teacher can enter students record, void display_all() – here it display all the students record ,void display_sp(int) – here it display an individual students record using roll no of the student  like this there are many function which do various tasks.
I learned how to use file handling – how to open/close a file ,write / read things form the file ,what are ifstream ,  ofstream ,inFile ,outFile etc.

This is my Second Project about Aurangabad Tourism


     Aurangabad Tourism
            
This is a Basic website containing a Home page about Aurangabad Tourism. Here I have use HTML and CSS. This Website also contains a Sign-up Page and a contact form.
Also tried to make it responsive.

Motivation behind this was to nothing but I wanted to try and implement what I have learned in HTML and CSS.  Also, I wanted to learn how a website is hosted using GitHub.
