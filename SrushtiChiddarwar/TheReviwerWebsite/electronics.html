			<div class = "review">The laptop has inbuilt DTS sound software packed as an add-on within Realtek driver. But the output from the speaker is not upto the mark. Use the free version of FX sound to get around this problem as it amplifies the audio. Output on headphones is good.In all, the laptop works good only if you upgrade the internals. Thats when you unleash it's potential.</div>

			<div class = "review">Mouse is very good in terms of build quality and also connects very fast to any computer (even if you use it in office where USB ports are disabled).Both Left and Right clicks work fine and click wheel is perfectly balanced in scrolling. Wheel also have matt and rough finish for better grip and having clicky feel while scrolling which enables user to get precisely right scroll.It only needs only one regular size cell and having one out of the box. which is good.</div>
