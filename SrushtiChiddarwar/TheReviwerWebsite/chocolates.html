			<div class = "review">Those crying about a little bitter taste dont understand that it is because that is what 80 percent dark chocolate should taste like, its natural taste. The other rival keto dark chocolates have stevia or other sweetners making half of the chocolate (i have tried those too, not much different) . Go for this one if you are looking for the benefits and not just the taste. The taste is not that bad either, its like a normal chocolate with a little tinge of bitter aftertaste.</div>

			<div class = "review">Good for someone who needs something to munch on every now and then : )
The flavour is not strong but quite authentic for the price. So and so, value for money.
Doesn't stick on the teeth and very light on the stomach. Could be a bit longer in my opinion but that's it.
The packaging could be improved a notch. The plastic container seems breakable but isn't that flimsy.
You could give it a try.</div>
