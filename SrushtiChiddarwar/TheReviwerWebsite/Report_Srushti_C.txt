I have made a product review website, 
where users can check reviews of products before buying them.
I have currently added 4 categories of products, each category
having 4 products. I have added a link to a website where the user
can buy the product.

They can submit their own reviews for a product in the form of rating 
and text description.
They can also contact us in case of queries or issues over mail 
as well as phone.

Both the form for rating submission and contacting have 
input validation and make use of alerts. Once submitted, 
the user is automatically redirected to the previous page.
I have used box model for our website and maintain a homogenous nature throughout

I have used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT in this project
